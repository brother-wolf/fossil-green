# Fossil Green

This is a rust application that reports fossil fuel usage of your AWS account.
It is based on the limited information that AWS provide around energy sources for data-centres.



A large credit has to go to [green-cost-explorer](https://github.com/thegreenwebfoundation/green-cost-explorer/blob/master/AWS-Regions.png) by [thegreenwebfoundation](https://github.com/thegreenwebfoundation) which I couldn't get to work but the idea, code, and navigation of the AWS Cost Explorer, is very sound.



```bashÂ§
USAGE:
    fossil-green --aws-profile <aws-profile> --end-date <end> --start-date <start>

For more information try --help

Notes:

# aws-profile (String)
# start-date (String of format: YYYY-MM-DD)
# end-date (String of format: YYYY-MM-DD)
```





Fossil Greenl authenticates using existing aws credentials
